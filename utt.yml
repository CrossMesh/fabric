    # [required] network mode. (could be: ethernet, overlay)
    #   ethernet:
    #     UTT works as a switch, relaying frames according to hardware address (MAC) via tunnels between network router peers.
    #     It forms a virtual large flat layer 2 ethernet.
    #
    #   overlay:
    #     UTT works as a router, relaying packets according to IP and subnet settings via tunnels between network router peers.
    #     Multiple routers may exists within a same subnet to balance network traffic.
